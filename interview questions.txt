1. What is Git and why use it?
Answer:
Git is a version control system. It helps track changes in code, work with different versions, and collaborate with other developers. I use it because it makes teamwork easier and keeps a history of my project.


2. How do you push code to GitHub?
Answer:
I first add files using git add ., then commit with git commit -m "message", and finally push with git push origin main.
It means I’m uploading my local work to my GitHub repo.


3. What is GitHub Pages?
Answer:
GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub. It lets me host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. Example: username.github.io.


4. Difference between static and dynamic websites?
Answer:
Static website → Only HTML, CSS, JS, same content for everyone. Example: Portfolio site.

Dynamic website → Content changes based on user or server data. Example: Facebook or e-commerce site.


5. How do you revert commits in Git?
Answer:
There are two main ways:

git revert <commit-id> → makes a new commit that undoes changes (safe way).

git reset → moves the branch back to an older commit (more risky).
In real projects, git revert is safer.


6. What is branching in Git?
Answer:
Branching means creating a separate line of development. It allows me to work on a new feature without disturbing the main code. Later, I can merge it back.


7. Explain pull requests.
Answer:
A pull request is when I finish work on a branch and ask the team to review and merge it into the main branch. It’s commonly used in collaborative projects.


8. How to resolve merge conflicts?
Answer:
Conflicts happen when two people change the same part of a file. To fix it, I open the file, choose the correct version (or combine both), then mark it as resolved, commit, and push again.


9. How to host a website for free?
Answer:
I can host a static website for free using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. For this task, I used GitHub Pages.


10. What is continuous deployment?
Answer:
Continuous deployment means whenever I push new code to the main branch, it automatically goes live without manual steps. It helps deliver updates quickly and reduces manual work.
